            <article>
                <p>Hello, and welcome to the first post to the Rustlog!</p>
<p>For everyone <em>not</em> interested about the author:
I'm <a href="http://mearie.org/about/kang-seonghoon.en">Kang Seonghoon</a>, a Korean software developer doing funky things.
In the world of Rust I'm probably best known for
<a href="https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-encoding">rust-encoding</a>, a comprehensive character encoding library.
I also happen to enjoy talking on Moznet #rust (as known as <code>Yurume</code>).</p>
<h2>So what the hell is this blog?</h2>
<p>I have a separate personal <a href="http://j.mearie.org/">journal</a> in my website.
Probably many of you wouldn't understand its contents;
it's almost Korean only, and even though I've done some works to
make the <em>whole</em> website bilingual,
the journal remains quite exclusive in Korean.
(I do have some <a href="http://j.mearie.org/tagged/english">English posts</a> though.)</p>
<p>Still, I have a desire to write useful posts in English.
That's why I sometimes write to <a href="https://gist.github.com/lifthrasiir/">Gist</a>.
It is technically not a blog, but at least it is a comfortable place
to write a Markdown post.
I also have been motivated by the concept of "worklog"
as a daily diary for logging the day's work.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give a shot.
<strong>Every Rust-related post in English from now on will go here.
Also, I'll try to write a short remainder about
whatever I've done with Rust every day ("worklog").</strong>
I know this is very hard from the experience,
but at least I'll try to do so.
I'm kind of a yak-shaving personnel,
but this time I chose to stick to <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>
as it seems easy to install and <em>forget</em> about it.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any feedback on the post available here,
but unless there is a link to the explicit feedback form,
please direct any feedback to my <a href="http://mearie.org/about/contact.en">personal email</a>.
I'm close to <em>hate</em> the direct comments, so sorry about that.
And obviously my writing solely represents my own opinion
and not my employer's or organization's. :)</p>            </article>
