Title: The Beginning
Date: 2014-12-06 18:48

Hello, and welcome to the first post to the Rustlog!

For everyone *not* interested about the author:
I'm [Kang Seonghoon], a Korean software developer doing funky things.
In the world of Rust I'm probably best known for
[rust-encoding], a comprehensive character encoding library.
I also happen to enjoy talking on Moznet #rust (as known as `Yurume`).

## So what the hell is this blog?

I have a separate personal [journal] in my website.
Probably many of you wouldn't understand its contents;
it's almost Korean only, and even though I've done some works to
make the *whole* website bilingual,
the journal remains quite exclusive in Korean.
(I do have some [English posts] though.)

[English posts]: http://j.mearie.org/tagged/english

Still, I have a desire to write useful posts in English.
That's why I sometimes write to [Gist].
It is technically not a blog, but at least it is a comfortable place
to write a Markdown post.
I also have been motivated by the concept of "worklog"
as a daily diary for logging the day's work.

So I'm going to give a shot.
**Every Rust-related post in English from now on will go here.
Also, I'll try to write a short remainder about
whatever I've done with Rust every day ("worklog").**
I know this is very hard from the experience,
but at least I'll try to do so.
I'm kind of a yak-shaving personnel,
but this time I chose to stick to [Pelican]
as it seems easy to install and *forget* about it.

I'd appreciate any feedback on the post available here,
but unless there is a link to the explicit feedback form,
please direct any feedback to my [personal email].
I'm close to *hate* the direct comments, so sorry about that.
And obviously my writing solely represents my own opinion
and not my employer's or organization's. :)
