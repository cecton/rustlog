Title: Worklog 2014-12-08

After some wrestling with rustc, I've taken some refresh.
I had a grand^Wstupid plan for improving [an],
by implementing a better spell-to-pronounciation algorithm and
using that to determine if the word starts with a vowel or not.
(Mostly for fun, but I also wanted to make some useful utility.)
I've now implemented an entirety of [Mark Rosenfelder's algorithm][spell]
which has some test code like this:

```rust
assert_eq!(spell_to_sound("coffee").as_slice(), "kòfë");
assert_eq!(spell_to_sound("market").as_slice(), "môrkêt");
assert_eq!(spell_to_sound("ugly").as_slice(), "ûglë");
assert_eq!(spell_to_sound("high").as_slice(), "hï");
assert_eq!(spell_to_sound("canal").as_slice(), "känâl");
```

...Well, it still fails for some dozens of cases but it looks nice.
(Here I really mean that this doesn't exactly match the known output of the algorithm.
Since the algorithm itself is approximate,
if the bug actually *improves* the error rate, I might leave it as is.)
