Title: Worklog 2014-12-13
Date: 2014-12-13 23:59

Due to the personal concerns I haven't do much things, but at least...

* I've updated [rust-encoding] and [rust-chrono] for opt-in `Copy`.
* I've pushed a small [fix][#19719] for [#19764].
* I... think I've opened two issues ([#19723] and [#19762]) and
  started to work on the former. Not much, though.

Unfortunately I didn't have spare time for working on [#19606].
Maybe for the next week.
