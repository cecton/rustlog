Title: Worklog 2014-12-20
Date: 2014-12-21 00:01

This week we saw another series of breakages via the macro syntax reform. :)
I still didn't have much time to keep up,
so I mostly did the minimal maintenance work,
but still there are some significant tasks I've done this week:

* [Encoding 0.2.8] has been released.
  This is a significant, non-language-change fix due to
  the recent change to the Encoding specification.
  I've found a [spec bug][encoding-bug] while working on that.
* I've written a small [RFC] for
  changing the `mod` keyword in `use` to the `self` keyword.
  This is my first RFC ever, so I'm glad the writing seems fine enough.
* I worked on the floating-point printing code of [rust-strconv]
  during the Korean Rust meetup today.
  I think I can release the initial version this week.
