A day for smaller works. :)

I've updated the horribly outdated [Periodic Table] of Rust Types.
The resulting table seems a lot clearer than the previous.
I've also received a series of suggestions and
reports of mistakes (oops) from /r/rust.

I've also pushed a [MaybeUTF8] library.
This was originally a part of [rust-zip] library,
but this is slightly undermaintained than [zip-rs],
and I basically kept it just compilable in the recent nightly.
In the long term I plan to merge some design of rust-zip into zip-rs,
and as a preparation I've separated this into a separate crate.
`MaybeUTF8` was what newer nightlies liked to break, anyway.
